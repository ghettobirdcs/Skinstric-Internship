# Skinstric Internship Project

This is the React project I built during my internship at Skinstric.

What it does (current):
- Simple flow: enter basic info, take or upload a photo, send it to an API, get back an estimated age / race / gender.
- Stores the basic data and results in localStorage for now.
- Uses a webcam (if allowed) or image upload (future friendly).
- Some basic animations and loading states.

Notes:
- The AI piece is still in progress. Results are fake data.
- Errors are mostly generic toasts right now.

Tech used: React, plain CSS, axios, react-webcam, react-toastify.

This is just an internship prototype, so there are things to improve (validation, accessibility, tests, etc.).

Thanks for looking :D
